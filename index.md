# Fraud Detection

Fraud detection using advanced AI & ML techniques. Support vector Machine, TensorFlow, CNN, RNN, XGBoost, Randome Forest, CART, CHAID all the possible techniques were used.

## MLOPS

> MLOPS involves understading of ML implementation end to end from development to getting it production ready. Most buisness start with a focus on AI ML solution but ignore how the solutions will be implemented. More than 80% of AI ML solutions don't get into production, that's where MLOPS comes in.
